Absolutely! Here's your custom `README.md` file in the same format, but adapted for your **Netflix Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Task 1)**:

# Internship - Day 1  
📊 Netflix Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
🗂️ Dataset: netflix_titles.csv  

This project was carried out as part of my internship task to clean and preprocess a raw dataset using Python (Pandas). The dataset I worked on is called "Netflix Titles Dataset", which contains metadata about shows and movies available on Netflix.

---

## 📥 Dataset Source  
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle's public dataset repository. Here's how I got it:

- I visited Kaggle – [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows).
- I downloaded the CSV file: `netflix_titles.csv`.
- I placed the dataset in my working directory to begin preprocessing.

---

## 🧹 Task Objectives  
The goal was to clean and prepare the dataset, which included handling:

- Missing values  
- Duplicates  
- Inconsistent text formatting  
- Date formatting  
- Column renaming  
- Data type corrections  

---

## 🔧 Steps Performed  

### 1. Loaded the Dataset  
The dataset was loaded using `pandas.read_csv()`:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("netflix_titles.csv")
```

---

### 🔍 2. Initial Data Overview  
Basic data insights were gathered using:

```python
df.info()
df.describe(include='all')
df.head()
```

✅ Total Rows: 8807  
✅ Total Columns: 12

---

### 🚫 3. Missing Values  
Checked using `df.isnull().sum()`

```python
# Replaced missing 'director' with 'Unknown'
df['director'] = df['director'].fillna('Unknown')

# Replaced missing 'cast' with 'Not Available'
df['cast'] = df['cast'].fillna('Not Available')

# Filled missing 'country' with 'Unknown'
df['country'] = df['country'].fillna('Unknown')

# Filled missing 'rating' with mode value
df['rating'] = df['rating'].fillna(df['rating'].mode()[0])

# Forward filled missing 'date_added'
df['date_added'] = df['date_added'].ffill()
```

---

### 🔁 4. Duplicate Rows  
Checked for duplicates using:

```python
df.duplicated().sum()
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```

✅ Result: Duplicates found and removed if any

---

### ✨ 5. Standardized Text Columns  
Made text columns more consistent:

```python
df['type'] = df['type'].str.lower()
df['country'] = df['country'].str.title()
```

---

### 🕒 6. Converted Date Format  
Standardized `date_added` using `datetime`:

```python
df['date_added'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_added'])
```

---

### 🏷️ 7. Renamed Columns  
Improved readability of column names:

```python
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip().str.lower().str.replace(" ", "_")
```

---

### 🔢 8. Fixed Data Types & Created New Features  
Ensured consistent data types and added useful features:

```python
df['release_year'] = df['release_year'].astype(int)

df['year_added'] = df['date_added'].dt.year
df['month_added'] = df['date_added'].dt.month
df['actor_count'] = df['cast'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split(', ')) if x != 'Not Available' else 0)
```

---

## ✅ Summary of Changes

| Task                         | Status |
|------------------------------|--------|
| Missing Values Handled       | ✅     |
| Duplicate Rows Removed       | ✅     |
| Text Fields Standardized     | ✅     |
| Date Format Converted        | ✅     |
| Column Names Renamed         | ✅     |
| Data Types Fixed             | ✅     |

---

## 📌 Conclusions  
The Netflix dataset is now cleaned and ready for further analysis or use in data science projects:

- All missing values are appropriately handled.
- No duplicate entries remain.
- Text formatting is consistent and clean.
- Dates are in `datetime` format.
- Additional useful features (`year_added`, `actor_count`) have been created.

This cleaned data can now be used confidently for analysis, visualizations, or building ML models.
